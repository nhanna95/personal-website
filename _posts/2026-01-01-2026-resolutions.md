Just wanted to send out a quick blog post with my resolutions for 2026. I wanted to focus on things that will mainly come from habits, though I added something I could theoretically do in one session.

In 2026, I hope to:

- Climb 3 V8s
- Read 26 books
- Watch 52 movies
- Write 20 blog posts
- Learn how to do a backflip

## January Goals

In addition to my goals for the year, I have a few goals for January. I won't be taking classes or anything during January and want to focus on rehabilitating some of my habits with this free time.

I have the following goals for January:

- 2 blog posts per week (at least one movie analysis and one book analysis)
- Read at least 10 pages each day
- Watch at least 12 movies

In addition, I have the following rules:

- No instagram
- No youtube unless stretching
- Read before bed every night (no phone)
