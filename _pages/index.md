<h1 class="h1">Hello</h1>

I'm Nixon Hanna. I'm currently a sophomore studying physics and math at MIT.

I plan to go into academia in the future, working on theoretical physics research. Although, I have been thinking more and more about AI safety recently and will most likely work in the field to some extent.

I have many interests outside of physics and AIS, though, including climbing, movies, reading, music (soul, jazz, hip-hop, r&b), physical media, philosophy, and many other things.

If you're interested, you can read more about my background [here]({{ '/about.html' | relative_url }}).

Feel free to [reach out]({{ '/contact.html' | relative_url }}) for any reason.

    <p>was created largely for the purpose of starting a personal blog.</p>
    <p>I believe writing about things is an incredibly effective way of developing one's own beliefs. Yet, I have rarely found myself writing about the things I care about recently. </p>
    <p>So, I'm starting this a blog to give myself a place to more often write about the things I'm thinking about.</p>
    <p>You can read more about what my blog will entail [here]({{ '/posts/welcome.html' | relative_url }}).</p>
