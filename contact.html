<p>The best way to get in touch is by email: <a href="mailto:noxin@mit.edu">noxin@mit.edu</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss something in further detail, you can schedule a meeting at <a
        href="{{ '/meet' | relative_url }}">nixonhanna.com/meet</a>.</p>
<p>The next best way to contact me would be <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nixonh_/">Instagram</a>, although there
    are periods when I don't check it regularly.</p>
