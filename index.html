<h1 class="h1">Hello</h1>

<p>I'm Nixon Hanna. I'm currently a sophomore studying physics and math at MIT.</p>
<p>I have been planning to go into academia working on theoretical physics research in the future. However, I have been
    thinking more and more about AI safety recently and will most likely work in the field in some capacity. I'm
    currently considering control, scalable oversight, evals, and/or policy work.</p>
<p>I have many interests outside of physics and AIS, though, including climbing, movies, reading, music (soul, jazz,
    hip-hop, r&b), physical media, philosophy, and many other things.</p>
<p>If you're interested, you can read more about my background and interests on the <a
        href="{{ '/about.html' | relative_url }}">about
        page</a> of this site.

<p>Feel free to <a href="{{ '/contact.html' | relative_url }}">reach out</a> for any reason.</p>

<section class="note">
    <h2 class="h2">This site…</h2>
    <p>was created largely for the purpose of starting a personal blog.</p>
    <p>I believe writing about things is an incredibly effective way of developing one's own beliefs. Yet I have rarely
        found myself writing about the things I care about recently.</p>
    <p>So I'm starting this blog to give myself a place to more often write about the things I'm thinking about.</p>
    <p>You can read more about what my blog will entail in my {% assign welcome_post = site.posts | where: "title",
        "Welcome to my blog" | first %}{% if welcome_post %}<a href="{{ welcome_post.url | relative_url }}">first
            post</a>{% else %}<a href="{{ '/blog.html' | relative_url }}">first post</a>{% endif %}.
    </p>

<section class="note">
    <h2 class="h2">A future blog series…</h2>
    <p>is currently in the works and will be 5-10 minute summaries of articles from <a
            href="https://blog.redwoodresearch.org/p/guide">Redwood Research's Reading List</a> written for the general
        public.
    </p>
    <p>The main goal of these posts will be to create a place for average people to get informed about AI safety. As a
        result, there will probably be many posts included that are not on the reading list but that I feel are very
        informative on the field.
    </p>
    <p>I'm hoping to have the first post released by the end of November.</p>
