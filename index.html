<h1 class="h1">Hello</h1>

<p>I'm Nixon Hanna. I'm currently a sophomore studying physics and math at MIT.</p>
<p>I have been planning to go into academia working on theoretical physics research in the future. However, I have been
    convinced more and more about the importance of AI safety recently and will most likely will be switching to the
    field (though, I plan to still graduate with a physics degree). I'm currently considering control, scalable
    oversight, evals, and/or policy work.</p>
<p>I have many interests outside of physics and AIS, though, including climbing, movies, reading, music (soul, jazz,
    hip-hop, r&b), physical media, philosophy, and many other things.</p>
<p>If you're interested, you can read more about my background and interests on the <a
        href="{{ '/about.html' | relative_url }}">about
        page</a> of this site.

<p>Feel free to <a href="{{ '/contact.html' | relative_url }}">reach out</a> for any reason.</p>

<section class="note">
    <h2 class="h2">This site…</h2>
    <p>was created largely for the purpose of starting a personal blog.</p>
    <p>I believe writing about things is an incredibly effective way of developing one's own beliefs. Yet I have rarely
        found myself writing about the things I care about recently.</p>
    <p>So I'm starting this blog to give myself a place to more often write about the things I'm thinking about.</p>
    <p>You can read more about what my blog will entail in my {% assign welcome_post = site.posts | where: "title",
        "Welcome to my blog" | first %}{% if welcome_post %}<a href="{{ welcome_post.url | relative_url }}">first
            post</a>{% else %}<a href="{{ '/blog.html' | relative_url }}">first post</a>{% endif %}.
